# Welcome to the Qualcomm Intelligent Robotics SDK (QIR SDK)

The Qualcomm® Intelligent Robotics(QIR) SDK is a collection of components that enable you to develop robotic features on Qualcomm platforms. This SDK is applicable to the Qualcomm Linux releases.

The QIR SDK provides the following:
- Reference code in Robot Operating System (ROS) packages to develop robotic applications.
- E2E（end-to-end）scenario samples to evaluate robotic platforms.
- Integrated cross-compile toolchain, which includes common build tools, such as aarch64-oe-linux-gcc, make, cmake, and ROS core.
- Tools and scripts to speed up the development.
- Provide some basic ROS nodes to help you build your ros application, such as qrb_ros_camera, qrb_ros_nn_inference,etc.

This will guide you through developing your first sample application. It explains how to:
- Flash the prebuilt Qualcomm linux image and configure the environment.
- Run sample applications.
- Develop sample applications using the prebuilt image and QIR SDK.
- Generate customized images and QIR SDK.
- Provide a Gazebo simulation environment for testing and debugging robotic applications.
